# CombatSystemDemo
This is a demonstration of the Delusions of Grandeur combat system. While this is an early version of the system, I believe it does a good job of demonstrating my vision. 

Please Note: I recommend using Unity version 2021.1.28

All later versions will cause errors with the 3D models
